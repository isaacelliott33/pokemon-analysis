This is my first project regarding the analysis of pokemon predictions of which pokemon will win based upon the analysis of the questions.  

Using R, we are going to proceed with Logistic Regression for now.  This may not be accurate, even including the correct CV procedure and picking
the most appropriate predictors... 

But I'm new, so this is just practice.
