# Pokemon Data Analysis

**Welcome to Weedle's Cave.**  Will you be able to predict the outcome of future matches?

To do it you will have the pokemon characteristics and the results of previous combats.

Three files are available. The first one contains the Pokemon characteristics (the first column being the id of the Pokemon). The second one contains information about previous combats. The first two columns contain the ids of the combatants and the third one the id of the winner. 

**Important:** The Pokemon in the first column attacks first.

The goal is to develop a Machine Learning model able to predict the result of future pokemon combats.

## My Notes

This is my first project regarding the analysis of pokemon predictions of which pokemon will win based upon the analysis of the questions.  

Using R, we are going to proceed with Logistic Regression for now.  This may not be accurate, even including the correct CV procedure and picking
the most appropriate predictors... 

But I'm new, so this is just practice.
